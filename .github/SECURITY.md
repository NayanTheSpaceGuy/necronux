# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is recommended to use the stable version, as it is thoroughly tested and widely used. The `develop` branch contains bleeding-edge commits that are not fully tested and should not be used in production environments.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| develop | :x:                |
